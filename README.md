Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
This simple console application challenges the player to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. It's a fun way to practice basic C++ concepts like loops, conditionals, user input, and random number generation.

ðŸ“‹ How to Play
Run the program.

The computer will secretly pick a number between 1 and 100.

Enter your guesses when prompted.

After each guess, you'll be told if your guess was too low, too high, or correct.

Keep guessing until you find the correct number!

When you guess correctly, you'll see how many attempts you took.
